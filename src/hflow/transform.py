"""The built-in transform: one MCAP in, one canonical episode out.

Not any MCAP. v1 transcodes JPEG/PNG camera images and losslessly inserts a
missing access-unit delimiter into already-encoded H.264 video. Other video
violations are refused rather than transcoded into shape, and raw image
channels are refused outright. Both fail loudly and name what is wrong. Run
``hflow doctor`` on a source file to see what the transform may need to bridge.

v1 behavior:

- Camera image channels (``sensor_msgs/msg/CompressedImage`` /
  ``foxglove.CompressedImage``, JPEG or PNG payloads) are transcoded to
  in-band H.264 ``foxglove.CompressedVideo`` (protobuf) on the same topic,
  GOP length from the preset and the stream's measured frame rate.
- Channels already carrying ``foxglove.CompressedVideo`` pass through after
  every message is validated against the canonical video constraints
  (``format="h264"``, one AUD-delimited access unit per message, SPS+PPS on
  keyframes, each channel starts on a keyframe). A missing AUD is prepended
  losslessly because the message already supplies the access-unit boundary;
  conforming messages remain byte-for-byte identical. Other violations fail
  loudly because the provenance stamp asserts conformance.
  Raw ``sensor_msgs/msg/Image``/``foxglove.RawImage`` is not supported in v1
  (explicit error).
- Every other channel passes through byte-for-byte with its original schema.
  A topic may name only one source channel. MCAP allows several channels to
  share a topic, but topic-keyed reads cannot represent that, and the default
  checks use those reads. The transform refuses the file with
  ``SourceNotConforming`` instead of publishing both channels (#597). The
  reader can still open an already-written file by channel id. Per-message
  ``sequence`` numbers and per-channel metadata maps are not carried through
  the batch reader seam and are dropped; both are rare and advisory.
- Topic-group chunking: camera-schema topics to the ``cameras`` group, bulk
  non-camera channels (mean payload over ``BULK_MESSAGE_BYTES`` -- point
  clouds, occupancy grids) to ``bulk``, everything else to ``state``, with
  per-topic overrides in the config that beat all of it (an override applies
  to every channel of that topic). The resolved topic-to-group map is written
  into ``provenance/v1``, because the assignment is partly data-derived and
  group names appear nowhere in the MCAP itself.
- Derived signals (``derived=``): each :class:`~hflow.resample.DerivedSeries`
  becomes a NEW channel in the state group -- message encoding ``json``, one
  message per grid point, schema ``derived/v1`` (jsonschema). Each derived
  channel's version and the resample policy version are stamped into
  ``provenance/v1``, and the derived topics+versions fold into
  ``pipeline_version`` so a changed derivation changes the content hash.
- ``ffmpeg_version`` is stamped only when video work actually happened (a
  transcode ran); otherwise the literal ``FFMPEG_VERSION_NOT_USED`` is
  written, so camera-less episodes never trigger the pinned-ffmpeg download.
- Source Metadata records and Attachments are copied through -- except a
  stale ``provenance/v1``, which is replaced by this transform's own stamps
  (schema_version, pipeline_version, ffmpeg_version, gop_preset, gop_seconds,
  source_uri).
- Messages are written in global log-time order; the writer distributes them
  to per-group chunk streams.
